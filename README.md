Why you chose each loop type for each challenge
For the 1st challenge I choose the while loop since we are unaware of how many times it will take to get to 1. 
On the 2nd challenge I used the for loop because I know we are looking for a certain range in numbers. 
Finally, for the 3rd challenge I used the nested loop since we needed more than one iteration. 
How your solutions work
Using the different loops. 
Any AI assistance used
